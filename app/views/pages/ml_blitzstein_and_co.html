  <b>Blitzstein Bank History</b>
</p>
<p>
  In 1889, shortly after Anna (Hannah) and Marcus (Moishe) Blitzstein arrived in Philadelphia from Odessa, they opened a private bank on the northeast corner of 4th and Lombard Streets known as M.L. Blitzstein and Co. The bank offered a range of financial services including saving and checking accounts, international money transfers, and the arrangement and sale of steamship tickets. In 1919, as the sale of steamship tickets slowed, the Blitzsteins' constructed a new building on the opposite northwest corner of 4th and Lombard Streets. After Anna's passing, her son Samuel M. Blitzstein and Constantine B. Voynow took over the operations. In the aftermath of the closure of another Philadelphia bank, Bankers Trust Company, panicked depositors began making large numbers of withdraws from M.L. Blitzstein and Co. leading to its closure on December 23, 1930. At the time of the bank's closure, it had an estimated 6,000 depositors.
