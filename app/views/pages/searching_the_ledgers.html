<h1>Searching the ledgers</h1>
<p>
  The simple search box is limited to searching by organization or date. The various fields of information contained within the ledgers such as passenger name, purchaser, address, steamer, etc. are not keyword searchable.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  An external index is available for the bulk of the ledgers. For ease of access, searching the external index prior to accessing the digitized steamship ticket purchase ledgers is recommended. Alternatively, browsing the digitized ledgers by date is the best method for locating an entry. For some ledgers, a handwritten name index provides another alternative method for locating entries. Inclusion of a handwritten index is noted on the individual bank pages and in the notes field for specific volumes.
