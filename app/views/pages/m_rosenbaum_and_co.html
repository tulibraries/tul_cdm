  <b>Rosenbaum Bank History</b>
</p>
<p>
  M. Rosenbaum and Co. was a private banking firm established in 1885 by Morris Rosenbaum, an Austro-Hungarian immigrant, and his wife, Hannah. Rosenbaum and Co. was located at 603 South 3rd Street and provided foreign exchange services and sold steamship and railroad tickets. In 1930, Morris retired from the private bank, turning operations over to Alexander S. Berkowitz. On December 27, 1934, M. Rosenbaum and Co. was taken over by the State Banking Department after an examination revealed that the bank failed to comply with certain conditions set by the state. At the time of its closing, the bank operated under the partnership of Alexander and Eugene Berkowitz, and A. Murray Spitzer.
